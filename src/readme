All jui components share the following naming conventions:

    Folder
        jui-plugin-name-here

    Plugin js file
        library-extend-from-here.juiPluginNameHere.js
        Ex: jquery.juiPluginNameHere.js


Jui Components are broken down into major categories:

    components  - Large encompassing components;  I.e.,
                gallery, slide show, audio player,
                media player plugins etc..

    effects     - Components that create specific ui effects.

    ui          - Ui specific components (usually composed together with
                other ui components to build larger,
                more encompassing components)

    utils       - Utilities that may be commonly used throughout the
                different components of the jui-eco-sphere.

    ** Note **
        The ui and components categories may become either or in
    the future.
