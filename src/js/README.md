###Naming Conventions
-----------
All jui plugins share the following naming conventions:

`jquery.juiPluginNameHere.js`


###Jui Components are broken down into major categories:
-----------
- effects     - Components that create specific ui effects (tentative).

- ui          - Ui specific components (usually composed together with
                other ui components to build larger,
                more encompassing components)

- utils       - Utilities that may be commonly used throughout the
                different components of the jui-eco-sphere.

###** Note **
-----------
    The ui and components categories may become either or in
the future.

@todo Consider putting all plugins in src/ui to simplify things.
